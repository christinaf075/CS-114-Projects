A collection of Python assignments consisting of written programs that:
1. Perform mathematical functions with scientific data
2. Mutate and iterate through dictionaries and files
3. Use NumPy to store data and perform vectorized calculations
4. Plot data using Matplotlib
5. Perform computations using recursive data structures (ex. trees and fractals)
6. Utilizes Big O notation to analyze code efficiency
